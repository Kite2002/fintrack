FinTrack is currently a web application that can fill in as a tool to facilitate users to segregate their expenses and incomes while getting the real-time report of their financial health. Users can also get a better insight into managing their finances more efficiently. Once the users integrate all the bank accounts with the application, the data automatically gets updated.
